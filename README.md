#CS50 Web 2023 Project 0 - Search App 'Doogle'
## CS50 Web - Programming with Python and JavaScript
## The first project from the CS50 web programming with Python and Javascript
### Objective -
The objective of such a project is to learn how to create a simple search application using CSS, HTML, and the Google search API. This helps us learn about the different web technologies like SCSS, HTML, CSS

Here are some specific objectives of the project:

1) Learn how to create a simple HTML form with a search bar and a submit button.
2) Learn how to use CSS to style the text input field and the submit button.
3) Learn how to use the Google search API to search for the query entered in the search bar.
4) Learn how to render a list of search results in the HTML document.
5) Learn about the different components of a search engine.

### Specification - 
The project has the  following requirements:

The website has at least three pages: 
1) One for regular Google Search (which must be called index.html), one for Google Image Search, and one for Google Advanced Search.
2) On the Google Search page, there should be links in the upper-right of the page to go to Image Search or Advanced Search. On each of the other two pages, there 
   should be a link in the upper right to go back to Google Search.
3) On the Google Search page, the user should be able to type in a query, click “Google Search”, and be taken to the Google search results for that page.
4) Like Google’s own the search bar should be centered with rounded corners. The search button should also be centered and should be beneath the search bar.
5) On the Google Image Search page, the user should be able to type in a query, click a search button, and be taken to the Google Image search results for that page.
6) On the Google Advanced Search page, the user should be able to provide input for the following four fields (taken from Google’s own advanced search options)
   Find pages with… “all these words:”
   Find pages with… “this exact word or phrase:”
   Find pages with… “any of these words:”
   Find pages with… “none of these words:”
7) Like Google’s own Advanced Search page, the four options should be stacked vertically, and all of the text fields should be left aligned.
8) Consistent with Google’s own CSS, the “Advanced Search” button should be blue with white text.
9) When the “Advanced Search” button is clicked, the user should be taken to the search results page for their given query.
10) Add an “I’m Feeling Lucky” button to the main Google Search page. Consistent with Google’s own behavior, clicking this link should take users directly to the 
    first Google search result for the query, bypassing the normal results page.
11) We encountered a redirect notice when using the “I’m Feeling Lucky” button. Not to worry! This is an expected consequence of a security feature implemented by 
    Google.
12) The CSS resembles Google’s own aesthetics.
